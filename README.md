üåç GreenVision: Gamified Environmental Education Platform
üöÄ Project Overview
GreenVision is an interactive, gamified web application designed to educate children about the environment. By transforming key environmental topics into engaging games and activities, our goal is to make learning fun and inspire a new generation of eco-conscious leaders. The platform features a dynamic waste-sorting game, a rewarding points system, and a clean, modern dark-mode interface.

Dynamic Waste-Sorting Game: A fast-paced drag-and-drop game for kids to learn about waste management. New items appear continuously to keep the challenge fresh.

Tutorials: Step-by-step guides for each game to ensure kids understand the rules before they start playing.

Points & Rewards: Earn points for completing games, which can be redeemed in an in-app Eco-Shop.

Leaderboard: Track progress and compete with friends from your school, state, or across the country.

DIY Projects: A dedicated section with video tutorials for fun, hands-on eco-friendly projects.

Responsive Design: A consistent and enjoyable user experience on any device, from desktop to mobile.

Dark Mode: A modern, clean dark-mode UI for reduced eye strain and a sleek look.
