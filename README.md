# Gamified_Environmental_Eduction_Platform.
GreenVision is a gamified platform for kids' environmental education. Through interactive games like our waste-sorting challenge, students learn about key topics like waste management and renewable energy. A rewarding points system and an Eco-Shop encourage continuous learning. It's a fun way for kids to become green heroes! ðŸŒ±
